"""
pnw_vehicle — the PNW fleet's capability view over CarParams.

ONE place that knows which cars support which pnw features. Feature code asks about CAPABILITIES
(veh.ces_shadow, veh.stock_acc_buttons, ...), never about fingerprints — adding a car means adding
it here, not hunting string comparisons across the tree (driver directive 2026-07-11).

Pure and defensive: works with a capnp CarParams reader, the structs dataclass, or None (returns
all-False capabilities), so UI code can call it before a car is fingerprinted.
