# PNW Pilot — openpilot for the Pacific Northwest

**PNW Pilot** is a fork of openpilot tuned for one job: driving in the PNW, especially the 
**I-5 corridor between Seattle, WA and central Oregon**.

```
commaai/openpilot          upstream
  └─ xnor-tech/openpilot   adds full legacy Tesla HW1/HW2/HW3 (Raven) support
       └─ dirkpetersen/pnw-pilot   ← this distribution (Pacific Northwest)
```

### Focus

- **Region:** map data ships for **Washington, Oregon, and Idaho** by default — the first map
  download auto-arms on a fresh device, no settings page required. (British Columbia is optional
  and can be added to the state list.)
- **Drives:** predominantly **Seattle ↔ Corvallis** on I-5; curve and longitudinal behavior is
  calibrated against real drive logs from that corridor.
- **Vehicles:** shaped entirely around two cars — a **2021 Tesla Model S Long Range Plus** (Raven
  class, HW3; the primary I-5 car) and a **2025 Ford F-150 Lightning**. Car-specific code is
  fingerprint-gated, so it stays inert on the other car.
- **Development:** all code is written by **Claude Code** and validated by the **Gemini MCP server**
  running inside Claude Code.
- **Hardware:** only the **comma 3X** is tested. The **comma four is completely untested and will
  likely not work.**

### Enhancements over upstream / xnor

- **Tesla Model S Raven (HW1/HW2/HW3) support** — inherited from the xnor base; the reason PNW
  forks xnor rather than commaai directly.
- **Ford F-150 Lightning (2025)** — fingerprint and SecOC support for the Flash truck.
- **Vision Turn Speed Control (VTSC)** — actively caps cruise speed through curves from the model's
  predicted path curvature, smooth by construction (gentle decel envelope, only ever reduces speed).
  Tuned to the I-5 Terwilliger curve.
- **Conditional Experimental Switching (CES)** — chill by default, automatically switches to
  Experimental mode for curves, low-speed, stop-lights, and slow leads; with a per-car gentle
  profile and an Off / Light / Standard selector.
- **OSM speed-limit display** — shows the current posted limit and warns on lower limits, sourced
  from the bundled PNW map data.
- **Nudgeless lane change + no-disengage-on-brake** — hands-light lane changes and braking that
  doesn't kick you out of engagement.
- **Blind-spot monitoring** and a **last-known-car indicator** on the offroad screen.
- **Networking** — tethering/hotspot NAT fix, perpetual tethering, priority-WiFi switching,
  GPS-gated WiFi scanning with a Set Home Location button, and an LTE throttle guard.
- **Smarter drive upload** — two-pass upload (small files automatically, video on real WiFi) with a
  deleter that preserves anything not yet uploaded.

Using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma four, available at [comma.ai/shop/comma-four](https://www.comma.ai/shop/comma-four).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma four allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 300+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma four to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it's possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it's not plug-and-play.


### Branches

Running `master` and other branches directly is supported, but it's recommended to run one of the following prebuilt branches:

| comma four branch      | comma 3X branch        | URL                                    | description                                                                         |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `release-mici`         | `release-tizi`         | openpilot.comma.ai                     | This is openpilot's release branch.                                                 |
| `release-mici-staging` | `release-tizi-staging` | openpilot-test.comma.ai                | This is the staging branch for releases. Use it to get new releases slightly early. |
| `nightly`              | `nightly`              | openpilot-nightly.comma.ai             | This is the bleeding edge development branch. Do not expect this to be stable.      |
| `nightly-dev`          | `nightly-dev`          | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-dev | Same as nightly, but includes experimental development features for some cars.      |
